# Keyword-FSM

A **Finite State Machine (FSM) keyword generator** developed for the **Digital Circuits II final project**.  

This tool generates FSM keywords, which can be used with FSM implementations available in my repositories.

## How to Run
- Use a **C compiler** to compile and execute the program.  

## How It Works
1. The program initializes a sequence of **28 zeros**.  
2. The user is prompted to input the positions of ones.  
3. Input continues until the user enters **29** to stop.  
4. The sequence is then **reversed** to correct the order.  
5. The final keyword is **printed to the screen**.
